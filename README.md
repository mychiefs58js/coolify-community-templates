# Coolify's Community Templates repository
Here you can find all the things required to add new services into Coolify.

## Which service is eligible to add to Coolify?
The following statements need to be true:

- Self-hostable.
- Open-source.
- Maintained (I do not want to add software full of bugs and 0 support), but exceptions could be made.

## Icons
The icon name should be the same as the `type` field in the template.

## Add new service
See [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTION.md)
